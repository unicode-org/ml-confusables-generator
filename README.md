# ML Confusables Generator

A pair of confusables is a pair of characters which might be used in spoofing
attacks due to their visual similarity (for example ‘ν’ and ‘v’). The wide range
of characters supported by Unicode poses security vulnerabilities. Security
mechanisms listed in UTS#39 (UTS #39) use confusable data
(https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt)
to combat such attacks. The purpose of this project is to identify novel pairs
of confusables using representation learning and custom distance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Python_FreeType](https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype)
- [Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah)
- [pybidi](https://github.com/ldo/pybidi)

### Installation
1. Download and install Docker: [Get Docker Here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. `git clone` and `cd` into git repository.
3. Make sure all submodules are updated: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

### Launch Jupyter Notebook Container
1. In project source folder, run `./scripts/start.sh`.
2. In any browser, go to `localhost:8888`.
3. Copy the token from terminal to browser to access Jupyter Notebook.

### Launch Command Line Environment Container
1. In project source folder, run `./scripts/start_cli.sh`.
2. Execute setup script `./scripts/setup.sh`.

### Interactive Shell in Running Container
1. Run `docker ps` to get container id/name.
2. Run `docker exec -it [CONTAINER_NAME/ID] /bin/bash`.

### Exit Docker Container
- In Jupyter Notebook terminal, type `ctrl` + `c`.
- In command-line interface, `exit`.

## Usage

### Han Script Confusable Generation
1. From [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AEjzkWi9eq8Nxqa99qhoMRbQYl8p5D4M?usp=sharing),
download `full_data.zip` (pre-generated images) file and unzip in `data/` directory.
2. From [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QWUDridC499uqmXJJZYKgUf2fPmlgAeB),
download `full_data_triplet1.0_meta.tsv` and `full_data_triplet1.0_vec.tsv` (pre-generated embeddings and labels) into `embeddings/` directory.
3. Create representation clustering object:
    ```python
    from rep_cls import RepresentationClustering
    rc = RepresentationClustering(embedding_file='embeddings/full_data_triplet1.0_vec.tsv',
                                  label_file='embeddings/full_data_triplet1.0_meta.tsv',
                                  img_dir='data/full_data/')
    ```
4. Generate confusables for specific chracter:
    ```python
    rc.get_confusables_for_char('褢')
    >>> ['裹', '裏', '裛', '裏']
    ```

### Full Walk-through
Check `main.ipynb`.

### Pre-trained CNN model
From [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ipofZ-BiQzZemFI-aaVnNsciuMUn0zjb?usp=sharing),
download `TripletTransferTF` (pre-trained model) folder into `ckpts/` directory.

### Source file generation
- To regenerate source files, in `source/` directory, run `python generate_source_file.py`.
- To check how the source file is selected, see `source/Radical-stroke_Index_Analysis.ipynb`.

## Repo Contents
